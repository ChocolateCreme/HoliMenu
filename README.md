In this project, I'm rebuilding the in-store menu for Holi Restaurant in Bedford, Massachusetts. The link to the original site is https://www.holibedford.com/instore-menu/. I used npm run dev to run my project locally.
I implemented a feature where users can search up a category that they may not know the meaning of. I added this interaction because I felt like it would be helpful for people who may not be too familiar with Indian food or Holi Restaurant in general. Next, I am planning to add a navigation bar at the bottom of the page to help users with dietary restrictions learn what meals would be the best for them. I put the navbar in but didn't get a chance to work on it yet.
